# Web API for Web Scraping

## Overview

This project is an experimental Python-based web API that scrapes data from websites and serves it in JSON format. It is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), providing a scalable solution for accessing scraped data via a REST API. This project is developed during my free time and is intended for experimental purposes.
